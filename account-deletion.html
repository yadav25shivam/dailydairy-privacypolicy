  <h1>Dairy Khata – Account & Data Deletion Request</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      Dairy Khata allows you to request permanent deletion of your account and associated data.
      Please read the steps below.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Send an email to <code>support@dairy-khata.com</code> with the subject line:
      <strong>"Account Deletion Request – Dairy Khata"</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Your email must include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your registered phone number (the number you used to sign in)</li>
      <li>Your name / dairy name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After we verify the request belongs to you, we will delete your account.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What will be deleted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your profile information (name, phone number)</li>
      <li>Your dairy records / milk collection and payment ledger data you created in the app</li>
      <li>Business details you added in Dairy Khata</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What may be kept (and why)</h2>
    <p>
      We may keep records that are legally required for accounting / tax / audit purposes,
      such as transaction history that involves other parties.
      If we keep this data, we remove your personal identifiers and keep it only in an
      anonymized / aggregated form.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How long it takes</h2>
    <p>
      We will complete account deletion (and personal data deletion) within 30 days
      after we confirm your request.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Uninstall vs. deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You can uninstall the Dairy Khata app at any time.
      However, uninstalling the app from your phone does <strong>not</strong> automatically
      delete the data stored in our systems.
      To permanently delete your stored data, you must follow the request process above.
